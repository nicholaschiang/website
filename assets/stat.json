  "title": "11th Grade Enrollment Over Time",
  "abstract": "A basic AP Statistics project summarizing the relationship between time and enrollment rates for 11th grade in the United States through both a one-variable and a two-variable analysis. \n By inspecting our scatterplot, we conclude that a moderately strong positive linear correlation between time and 11th grade enrollment rates exists. We modeled that relationship using a least-squares regression line (LSRL). Using this model, we predict that every year, 11th grade enrollment rates will increase by about 31,422 students. \n Through our analysis, we discovered that generally, as time went forward, 11th grade enrollment rates increased. We believe that this increase is primarily the result of an increasing population. \n Between 2006 and 2012, however, change in 11th grade enrollment rates remained stagnant and actually decreased slightly over time. We attribute this decline to the 1990s economic recession which led to a decrease in birth rates within the US: less children were born between 1989 and 1996 who would have been 11th grade students (16-17 years old) between 2006 and 2012.",
